# Data Science - Unit 1 Sprint 2 Module 3 | BloomTech

## Module Project: Introduction to Bayesian Inference

### Introduction
In this project, we're going to practice calculating conditional probabilities. We will use Python and the pandas cross tabulation method to look at various survival scenarios. 
After completing the Titanic calculations, we'll visit the Harry Potter Universe and apply what we learned to the Sorting Hat situation at Hogwarts (a detailed description of the problem is provided - you don't need to have any familiarity with the Harry Potter books or movies).

### Data set
We'll be working with the Titanic dataset for this Module Project. It is available in various locations but the data at the URL provided is what we'll use today.
